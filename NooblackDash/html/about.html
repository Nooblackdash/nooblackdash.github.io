    <div class="text">Well this is the part of the site where I have to talk a bit about myself haha<br>
    So my name is Anish. On the internet you can call me NooblackDash or Nooby. it doesn't matter. I'm a passionate French and Cameroonian fella that is always excited to learn new stuffs, mainly centered about tech. I'm mostly known for making levels in a game called <b>Geometry Dash</b>. I am also a YouTuber making content about the same game with a few subscribers.<br><br>
    The computer I use to work with is really old (13 years old) and I really struggle with it. It is almost impossible to work/play with this computer without facing so much lag, meaning I cannot edit videos properly or play games with constant FPS. I'm trying to save for a new compter but it is hard since I have so many problems while saving my money. <br><br>
    Sometimes I feel really sad and suicidal and I feel like mentioning it because it kind of became a part of me. For the suicidal part, I'm recovering from it, since because of these thoughts I've lost a bunch of abilities to do stuffs, such as drawing, coding, and many things that involves some technical intervention. One of the only thing that keeps me alive and happy is Geometry Dash, and I'll never be grateful enough to RobTopGames for creating such an awesome game! (even if the community isn't really the best haha)
